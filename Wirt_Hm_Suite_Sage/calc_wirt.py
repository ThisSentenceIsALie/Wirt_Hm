A note on what the knot dictionary is:
The output knot dictionary is of the form
            d_k = {
                s_i: [(gauss_subseq), [c_1, c_2,...]]
                .
                .
                .
            },
where s_i is the name of the strand, gauss_subseq is a tuple representing the subsequence of the Gauss code
corresponding to the the strand, and the c_i represent the crossings that s_n are over.  The c_i are tuples 
(s_i_1, s_i_2), where s_i_1 and s_i_2 are the names of the strands that s_i is over.
