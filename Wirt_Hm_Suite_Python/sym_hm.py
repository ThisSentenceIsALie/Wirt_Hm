Note that in the next function, I have decided to first assign a transposition to each strand, then check to make sure all crossings obey the wirtinger relations. While it
would be possible to check this while running through the assignments, I believe that for large knots this would slow the program down significantly. Large knots may require
quite a few iterations of the assignment loop, and if the program must check every already-fully-assigned crossing every iteration, the pace of calcualtion might get a bit
ridiculous. I believe it will be far faster in the long run to have two seperate loops.
