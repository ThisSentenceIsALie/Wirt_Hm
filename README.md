# Wirt_Hm
Code and data associated with an exhaustive search for homomorphisms to finite Coxeter groups for knots with 16 or fewer crossings. The code is capable of processing knots with up to 702 crossings, though the exhaustive search is limited to knots with a Wirtinger number of five or less.

Wirt_Hm_Suite_Sage is the full version, written in the SageMath language, that can carry out exhaustive searches for surjective homomorphisms to symmetric, D, and H groups.

Wirt_Hm_Suite_Python has reduced functionality, being incapable of carrying out searches to H groups, but can be run by a python interpreter verison 2.7.1 or later.
